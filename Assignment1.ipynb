    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
    "\"Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was first released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "\"Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It also has support for automatic memory management, making it a popular choice for scripting, data analysis, and artificial intelligence applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "\"Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers (e.g. variable names, function names, etc.). For example, the names variable and Variable would be treated as two different identifiers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
    "The correct extension for a Python file is '.py'. This extension is used to indicate that a file is a Python source code file and can be executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "\"Python code is interpreted, not compiled. When a Python program is run, the Python interpreter reads the code and executes it line by line, rather than compiling the code into machine-readable binary form first. This makes the development process faster and more flexible, but may result in slower performance compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n",
    "\"In Python, there are several blocks of code used to define a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) Functions: A block of code that performs a specific task, and can be called multiple times within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Classes: A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) If-else statements: A control structure that allows the program to make decisions based on a specific condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Loops (for, while): A control structure that allows the program to repeat a block of code multiple times, until a specified condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Try-except blocks: A block of code that allows the program to handle errors and exceptions in a predictable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "In Python, the hash symbol (#) is used to give single-line comments. Everything to the right of the hash symbol on a line is ignored by the Python interpreter and is used to provide annotations and explanations in the code. For example:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #This is a single-line comment in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? \n",
    "\"There are two built-in functions in Python that can be used to find the version of Python that you are currently working with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) sys.version: This function returns a string containing information about the version of Python you are using, including       the release number, build date, and compiler information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) sys.version_info: This function returns a named tuple that contains information about the version of Python you are using,    including the major, minor, and micro release numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "     import sys\n",
    "    print(sys.version)\n",
    "    print(sys.version_info)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called \n",
    " \"lambda.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python? \n",
    "\"pip\" is an acronym for \"Pip Installs Packages.\" It is the default package manager for Python and is used to install and manage packages for Python applications. With pip, you can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or from other sources. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and remove packages, making it an essential tool for Python developers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python? \n",
    "\"Here are some of the most commonly used built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) print(): prints the specified message to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) len(): returns the number of elements in a list, tuple, set, dictionary, or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) str(): converts a number or other data type into a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) int(): converts a string or float into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) float(): converts a string or integer into a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) type(): returns the data type of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "g) sum(): returns the sum of the elements in a list or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "h) min() and max(): return the minimum and maximum values in a list or tuple, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "i) sorted(): returns a sorted list from a list or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "j)abs(): returns the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive list, but these functions are used frequently in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python? \n",
    "\"In Python, there is no specific maximum length for an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.). An identifier can be as long as your system's memory can handle. However, it is recommended to keep identifier names short, descriptive, and easy to read, to maintain good coding practices and to avoid naming collisions with other identifiers in the same codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "\"There are many benefits of using Python as a programming language:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Easy to Learn: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it a great language for beginners to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Large Community: Python has a large and active community, with many resources and libraries available for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cross-platform: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a great choice for cross-platform development.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dynamically Typed: Python is dynamically typed, meaning that you don't need to specify data types when declaring variables. This makes the development process faster and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Readable and Maintainable Code: Python code is often more readable and maintainable than code written in other languages, making it easier to collaborate with other developers and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Plenty of Libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries and modules available, which makes it easier to develop applications without having to write all the code from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the benefits of using Python, and there are many more depending on the specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "\"In Python, memory management is automatic and is handled by the Python interpreter's memory manager. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for objects, as well as handling memory allocation for low-level data types like integers and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a reference counting system to track the number of references to an object. When the reference count for an object reaches zero, the memory occupied by that object is automatically deallocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python also has a garbage collector that periodically frees up memory that is no longer being used. The garbage collector keeps track of objects that are still in use, and reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Python's memory management is efficient, flexible, and takes care of the low-level details of memory management, freeing up the developer to focus on writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables? \n",
    "\"Here are the steps to install Python on Windows and set the path variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Download the Python installer from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Run the installer by double-clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Select the \"Add Python 3.x to PATH\" option during the installation process. This will automatically set the path variables for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Complete the installation process by following the on-screen instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)To confirm that Python has been installed and the path variables have been set correctly, open a Command Prompt and run the following command: python. If Python has been installed successfully, you should see the Python interpreter prompt >>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)To set the path variables manually, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Right-click on the Start menu and select System.\n",
    "b. Click on Advanced system settings.\n",
    "c. Click on the Environment Variables button.\n",
    "d. Under System Variables, scroll down and find the Path variable.\n",
    "e. Click on the Edit button.\n",
    "f. Add the path to the Python executable (e.g., C:\\Python3\\) to the end of the Path variable.\n",
    "g. Click OK to close all windows and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python? \n",
    "\"Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to define blocks of code, such as loops and functions. In Python, indentation is used instead of curly braces {} or keywords like begin and end, which are used in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a loop in Python is defined like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "      for i in range(10):\n",
    "      print(i)\n",
    "      \n",
    "In this example, the code inside the loop is indented four spaces, indicating that it is part of the loop. In Python, a consistent indentation style is important, as indentation determines the structure of the code. Typically, a standard indentation size of four spaces is used in Python, but it can be any number of spaces as long as it is consistent within a single code block.\n",
